## What is Rush 2049 TE?
Rush 2049 TE (Tournament Edition) is a special arcade release of Rush 2049 with a plethora of extra features.

It included some modifications to the base game content as well as the ability to connect to a central server, play games online with other 2049 TE machines, access rankings, and even hold official tournaments.

This relied on Midway's own custom online service, the Midway Tournament Network (or MTN for short).
Unfortunately this was short-lived as the service was a colossal failure with Midway shutting down the service shortly after its debut, and leaving online features for their games (including 2049 TE) inaccessible today.
